## How was it built :building_construction:

This project it's a Single Page Application made with HTML / CSS / JS.
The application is divided in 4 screens

![Screen1](/img/readme-img/Screen1.png)

Here you can see the logo of the game and by clicking on the screen you can move to the second screen.

![Screen2](/img/readme-img/screen2.png)

In this section you can choose the rider that you like and start the fight.

![Screen3](/img/readme-img/screen3.png)

Here by clicking on "FIGHT!" you will make rider1 and rider2 attack, the attack depend on the lucky that the rider is, a function will generate a random number from 1 to 10 and add it to the inicial attack of the rider.
